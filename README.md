# Golf Vision

This project is an extention of trt_pose for golf swing analysis capable of running on Jetson TX2.

## Getting Started

### Step 1 - Install trt_pose and it's dependencies

To get started, follow the instructions found here: https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/trt_pose.

Once all dependencies have been installed for trt_pose, our team's reproduction can be run by executing `human_pose/live_demo.ipynb`

### Step 2 - Install trt_pose_hand and it's dependencies

To get started, follow the instructions found here: https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/trt_pose_hand.

Once all dependencies have been installed for trt_pose_hand, our team's reproduction can be run by executing `trt_pose_hand/live_hand_pose.ipynb`
